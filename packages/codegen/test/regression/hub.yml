        The each of the `deployments` will have an array of `targets` if the `Deployment` requires
        a `Connection`. All the `Connections` specified for that `Deployment` will be listed under

      summary: Create a new Registration
      description: |-
        This operation creates a new node. Nodes are identified by the system by the BIOS UUID of the machine they are running on. The alternate identifier is the MAC address of the machine. During the initial handshake, the MAC address will be used to sync the BIOS UUID number. Once the BIOS UUID is set, it becomes the primary identifier and is then indelible.
        This method does not actually create an `Node` model, however - it just stores the registration. The registration is resolved when the node with the given MAC address connects.
